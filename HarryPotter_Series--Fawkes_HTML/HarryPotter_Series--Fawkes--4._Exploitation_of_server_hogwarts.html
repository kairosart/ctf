Exploitation of server_hogwarts</h1><br/><br /><strong>Buffer overflow</strong><br /><br />Buffers are memory allocations that are  volatile, they temporarily hold the data while transferring data from  one location to another. A buffer overflow occurs when the data being  processed exceeds the storing capacity of the memory buffer. This  results in the program overwriting oversized data in the adjacent memory  locations which lead to overflow of the buffer. A buffer overflow  occurs when we operate on buffers of char type.<br />We will try to understand this concept  with few examples. For example, a buffer is designed in such a way that  it would accept 8 bytes of data, in such a scenario if the data inputted  by the user is more than 8 bytes then the data which is over 8 bytes  would overwrite the adjacent memory surpassing the allocated buffer  boundary. This would ultimately create segmentation faults followed by  many other errors resulting in program execution is terminated.<br /><br /><a href=""><img src="images/478-1.png" alt="images/478-1.png" /></a><br /><br />As we can see in the above  representation, the memory allocated was 8 bytes while the data inputted  by the user was 10 bytes which surpassed the buffer boundary, and those  extra 2 bytes of data (E &amp; R) overwritten the adjacent memory  locations. <br /><br />From <a href="https://www.hackingarticles.in/a-beginners-guide-to-buffer-overflow/">https://www.hackingarticles.in/a-beginners-guide-to-buffer-overflow/</a><br /><br /><p align="center"><img src="images/home.svg" height="22" width="22">  <a href="index.html">Index</a></p></div></body></html>
