This is especially useful for obscuring an open network port from port scanning since the port in question will be closed unless the port knocking sequence is executed. A long enough port knocking sequence is practically impossible to brute force: for example, to successfully guess (by brute force) a combination of 3 TCP ports, an attacker would have to try knocking on each of the 281 trillion possible combinations, and scan for open ports after each port knocking sequence. As you can probably imagine, this would take a very, very long time.<br /><br />    <img src="images/682-1.png" alt="images/682-1.png" /><br />    From <a href="https://www.howtoforge.com/how-to-obscure-network-ports-with-a-port-knocking-sequence-on-debian-10/#step-testing.">https://www.howtoforge.com/how-to-obscure-network-ports-with-a-port-knocking-sequence-on-debian-10/#step-testing.</a><br />    <br />1.
